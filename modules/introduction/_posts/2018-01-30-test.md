From the Course in a Box [modules section](http://howto.p2pu.org/modules/tutorial/modules/):

>You should now see a folder named introduction inside the modules folder. The introduction folder should contain a folder called _posts and the _posts folder should contain a file called 2000-01-01-test.md. That last file is a section of your module, but more on that in the next section.

>Once you are done with this tutorial, you should add all the modules that you wish to use. You can also create your modules by renaming the modules that are already there.

I changed the file name to '2018-01-30-test.md'
